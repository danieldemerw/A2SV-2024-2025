<p> Suneet has three digits a
, b
, and c
.

Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to 10
.

Output "YES" if there is such a pair, and "NO" otherwise.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a
, b
, c
 (0≤a,b,c≤9
).

Output
For each test case, output "YES" if such a pair exists, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).<code>O(nlog(n))</code> time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [5,2,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,3,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,0,1,1,2,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
